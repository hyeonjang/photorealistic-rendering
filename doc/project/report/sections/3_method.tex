\section*{Method}\label{ch:ch3label}

In this section, we first introduce the modifed gradient descent method using a property of the target parameter, which shown in the previous work\cite{Nicolet2021Large}. Then, we translate this technique to our target domain, which is image.

\subsection*{Modified gradient descent}
\begin{align}{\label{eq1}}
	x \leftarrow x - \gamma (I + \lambda L)^{-p} 
\end{align}

We need to modify the gradient descent as
The simply form
This form ot 
work as the gradient filtering in mesh

\subsection*{Laplacian operator on image processing}
\begin{align}{\label{eq2}}
	\frac{dL}{dc_t} = 0 \implies \beta^t\frac{1}{c_t}-\beta^t(\mu_t+\lambda_t)P_t=0 \implies \frac{1}{c_t}=(\mu_t+\lambda_t)P_t
\end{align}
In the case of mesh, appears as the matrix, 

In image processing, laplacian operator can be derived from kernel.
Image kernel

\subsection*{Step size selection}
There i and previous work choose this value as 15~50 by the abbreviation study
Currently, I just apply learing rate.

\subsection*{Biased method:gradient filtering}
How about directly filtering gradients? As the from the hint of laplcian

This will be discussed in the result section.
